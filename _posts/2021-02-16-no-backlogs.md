title: No Backlogs

#Welcome

First, there was a movement within the agile community around "no estimates". There's a lot to be said about, in practice, how the process of estimation is misused and abused.

There's an even bigger problem, mostly within the "agile product community" around backlogs. The product backlog, an artefact from Scrum, is similarly a tool that has been misused and abused.
